# Diabetes Level Prediction using Big Data Analytics

This repository provides the detailed analysis of Diabetes dataset taken from UC

# Objective
The main objective of our project is to predict the risk of a person having diabetes using their lifestyle details and by implementing algorithms using PySpark and other code bases (i.e. Scikit-learn and PyTorch). Determining what are the most important lifestyle factors that has a major effect on risk of diabetes.​ Finally, we will be analyzing the outcome of our analysis and determine solutions on how to reduce the risk of diabetes.​ In summary, we will be using big data methodologies for performing big data analytics and developing predictive models for diabetes risk prediction.​
