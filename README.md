# Diabetes Level Prediction using Big Data Analytics

The main objective of our project is to predict the risk of a person having diabetes using their lifestyle details and by implementing algorithms using PySpark and other code bases (i.e. Scikit-learn and PyTorch). Determining what are the most important lifestyle factors that has a major effect on risk of diabetes.​ Finally, we will be analyzing the outcome of our analysis and determine solutions on how to reduce the risk of diabetes.​ In summary, we will be using big data methodologies for performing big data analytics and developing predictive models for diabetes risk prediction.​

# Dataset Description

The dataset has been taken from UC-Irvine Machine Learning Repository.​ The dataset consists of 253,680 survey responses of people, with 21 features. ​"Diabetes_012" is the target variable predicting the risk of diabetes.​ The dataset contains potentially sensitive information such as Gender, Education and Income.​ The dataset helps identify relationship between lifestyle and diabetes in US.​
